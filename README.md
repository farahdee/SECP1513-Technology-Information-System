## Reflection
Throughout this course, I gained a solid understanding of the basics of IT and how it’s used within organizations, especially in areas like data management and system design. I also learned about essential components such as hardware, software, and networking, and how information systems help support decision-making in real situations. One thing I really appreciated was the PC Assembly Lab Practical is that it was hands-on, engaging, and helped me and my classmates truly understand how different PC components work. I hope there will be more practical sessions like this in the future because they make the learning experience more meaningful. I also enjoyed the PPG Industry Talk, which gave us valuable insight into real job roles, required skills, and career paths that we don’t usually hear about in textbooks. More industry sharing sessions like this would be incredibly helpful for students. Overall, this course has strengthened my understanding of how IT professionals play an important role across different industries. It also motivated me to not only focus on building technical skills but to think about how to apply them in real-world contexts so the knowledge becomes truly useful.
