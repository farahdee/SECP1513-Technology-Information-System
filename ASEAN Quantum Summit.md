## Summary
The session introduced the Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT) and its role as a national hub for advancing quantum research through collaboration with leading institutions such as NUS and partner universities. The talk highlighted six major research domains, including quantum computing, communication and security, sensing, devices, biology, and interdisciplinary quantum science.

It also outlined how quantum technologies are translated into real-world impact through application domains like computational biology, quantum chemistry, finance, and combinatorial optimisation. A layered platform architecture was presented, covering everything from low-level hardware control and error correction to high-level APIs and hybrid classical-quantum workflows.

## Reflection
This session gave valuable insight into how quantum technology is not just theoretical, but actively being structured into scalable platforms and real applications. It helped me bunderstand how research, infrastructure, and industry collaboration are interconnected in building a national quantum ecosystem.

I found it especially interesting to see how hybrid classical–quantum computing plays a key role, showing that quantum systems complement rather than replace classical computing. Overall, the talk broadened my perspective on potential career pathways and research opportunities in emerging quantum fields.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Include more simplified explanations or real-life examples for students who are new to quantum concepts.
- Add case studies or success stories showing how quantum research has already been applied in industry.
